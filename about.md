This is my digital nature journal. I use it to log field observations, sketches, and small moments outdoors. 

**What I record**
- Date, time, and location (approximate if needed)
- Weather and conditions
- Species seen or heard
- Plants in bloom or fruit
- Tracks, scat, and other signs
- Questions to follow up on

*Made with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.*
