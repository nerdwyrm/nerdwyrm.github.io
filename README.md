# NerdWyrm Nature Journal (Jekyll on GitHub Pages)

A lightweight, zero-maintenance blog for field notes. Built with the `midnight` theme and GitHub Pages–supported plugins.

## Posting
I will periodically post un-edited entries from my Obsidian.md notes app. I try to keep these clean and tidy but sometimes they lose a little formatting in translation.
