## Quick Context

- **Purpose/Focus of outing:** Midday walk to track river clarity, bird activity, and note plant and insect finds 

- **Route/Area covered:** Colorado Street Bridge to the small feeder creek area and back; scans of north-bank eddies and open channel; pause to watch large soaring birds 

- **Notable phenology today:** Poison hemlock growth noticed and identified via Seek; small brown butterfly on the wing despite cool season

## Observations

### Species/Things Observed

- [ ] Great Blue Heron (*Ardea herodias*) - standing motionless on a log about 1 ft up the far bank; photos taken 

- [ ] Turkey Vultures (*Cathartes aura*) or similar - 3 to 4 large birds circling over the bridge near the feeder creek, hovering and soaring in the breeze 

- [ ] Canada Geese (*Branta canadensis*) - two individuals resting calmly in an eddy on the north side 

- [ ] Northern Cardinal (*Cardinalis cardinalis*) - loud, persistent song on the north side 

- [ ] Carolina Wren (*Thryothorus ludovicianus*) - song heard 

- [ ] Mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*) - male seen later in the walk 

- [ ] Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*) - single individual on the greenway, noticed thanks to Izzy the dog, companion of Toni the birder. 

- [ ] Small brown butterfly - distant and not identified 

- [ ] Poison Hemlock (*Conium maculatum*) - softball-sized green bough; ID via Seek; photo captured 

- [ ] River/Water - still rather murky; similar clarity to yesterday 

- [ ] People - spoke with Herb about fishing and with two birders (Toni, and unnamed photographer); one photographed the heron; another mentioned recent white-breasted nuthatches and brown creepers that I did not see today. Another angler also noted no success catching fish.

  

### General Description of Activities

Walked the usual bridge stretch, scanning eddies for waterfowl and the channel and sky for larger birds. Stood still to observe the blue heron; watched soaring vultures working the downriver breeze; had several brief trail conversations.

  

### Descriptions & Field Notes

- **Great Blue Heron** 

  - ID: Familiar and distinctive, confirmed by other birders on path taking photos
 
  - Posture: Upright and still; not actively hunting 

  - Micro-site: On a log about 1 ft up the opposite bank, about 100ft west along the river from the feeder creek bridge. 

  - Photos/Sketch: add photo later

  

- **Large soaring Turkey Vultures** 

  - ID: Large size, viewed soaring from below front of wings solid black with white feathers on tips and entire length of back of the wing.
  
  - Behavior: Soaring low near small feeder creek bridge, using steady downriver breeze to hover and oscillate between riverbanks
 
  - Photos/Sketch: add photo later

  

- **Poison Hemlock** 

  - ID: Identified via Seek; I recognize spring flowers in online photos from past seasons 

  - Photos/Sketch: add photo later

  

- **Fishing notes from Herb** 

  - Zone between Colorado and Apperson Street bridges is a delayed harvest area with catch and release only and artificial lures only 

  - River recently stocked with trout; Herb has previously caught very small smallmouth bass here 

  - When the river is deep and relatively clear with food drifting, fish are spread out and less aggressive and harder to catch. Murky water drives them into hiding spots. Clear water and medium speed flow is best for fishing.

  

- **Birders’ intel** 

  - Another birder (Toni) reported recent sightings of white-breasted nuthatches and brown creepers, though I did not observe them today
 
  - Unnamed bird photographer noted that he is aware of 4 blue heron individuals and has taken many excellent photos of them in this area. Some good enough to frame. Using a Sony 6700 camera with Tamron brand lens.

  

### Behavior & Patterns

- Breeze-assisted soaring allowed prolonged observation of large birds. Heron presence suggests adequate foraging habitat nearby even with murky water. 

- Despite stocking and angler effort, fishing success remains low per Herb’s report, likely due to current flow and clarity conditions.
