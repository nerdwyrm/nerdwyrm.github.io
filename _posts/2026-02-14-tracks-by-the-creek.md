Overnight dusting made for perfect tracking. Along the sandy bend, I found a jumble of small prints.

**Tracks**
- Raccoon: five-toed, hand-like impressions, alternating path along the bank
- Great Blue Heron: long, three-toed prints spaced widely near shallow water

**Weather**: Calm, 28°F, high thin clouds.
