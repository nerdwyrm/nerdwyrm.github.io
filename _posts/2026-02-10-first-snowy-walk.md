A quiet afternoon walk along the greenway. Thin snow crust underfoot, creek edges glazed with ice. 

**Sightings**
- Northern Cardinal pair near the sycamores
- Three American Crows calling overhead
- Fresh white-tailed deer tracks crossing the path

**Notes**
- Juncos favoring the brush piles near the parking lot
- Ice shelves along slower pools—watch for melt by weekend warm-up
