# 2026-02-18 – Nature Journal

> **Time:** 12:00 - 13:00

> **Location:** 

>   General: Greenway (river corridor) 

>   Specific: Between Colorado Street Bridge and Apperson Street Bridge

> **Coordinates/Elevation:** 

> **Companions:** None 

> **Habitat:** Riparian corridor with river, grassy banks, shrubs, and scattered hardwoods (incl. sycamore), winter–early spring vegetation

## Weather

**Current** 

- Temp: ~55 °F (Much cooler than yesterday)

- Sky: Overcast 

- Wind: (not noted) 

- Precipitation: None during walk 

  

**Recent** 

- Last 24h: Rain overnight with thunder & lightning; ground soggy; river swollen

- Last week / seasonal context: Forecast calls for on‑and‑off rain through the week; snowpack now completely gone; river level similar to yesterday with potential for flooding if rain persists

  

---

  

## Quick Context

- **Purpose/Focus of outing:** Midday walk from work; observing river conditions, wildlife, and seasonal transitions; casual birding.

- **Route/Area covered:** Greenway entrance near Graham White → Colorado Street Bridge → across small feeder creek. → toward park bench near Apperson Street Bridge → back along same route

- **Notable phenology today:** 

  - Early emergence of [[lesser celandine]] forming a green carpet after snow melt 

  - Increased songbird activity/calling 

  - Numerous [[sycamore]] seed pods on the ground (possibly storm-driven drop) 

  - [[Stoneflies]] active on bridge/railing 

  - First-time personal observation: squirrel entering its nest

## Observations
### Species/Things Observed

- [ ] **Blue Jay** (*Cyanocitta cristata*) - flying east along river center; perched at top of tallest sycamore on north side 

- [ ] **Canada Goose** (*Branta canadensis*) - multiple groups & individuals: 

  - 1 lone goose flying west and landing mid‑reach 

  - 4 grazing on south-side grass 

  - ~13 individuals crossing Greenway N→S (separate event) 

  - Later event: 4 swimming upriver together with a lagging loner; interactions suggestive of territorial or mating behavior (hypothesis) 

- [ ] **Mallard** (*Anas platyrhynchos*) - male with green head among geese, tolerated by flock 

- [ ] **Song Sparrow** (*Melospiza melodia*) - multiple calls; varied song types noted; photo taken (add later) 

- [ ] **Yellow‑rumped Warbler** (*Setophaga coronata*) - ID by Merlin (heard; brief visual in riverside shrubs) 

- [ ] **White‑crowned Sparrow** (*Zonotrichia leucophrys*) - Merlin audio ID; no confirming visual 

- [ ] **American Robin** (*Turdus migratorius*) - bright red breast on display perched on wood post, calling 

- [ ] **Northern Cardinal** (*Cardinalis cardinalis*) - heard calling, Merlin bird ID confirmed 

- [ ] **Rock Pigeon** (*Columba livia*) - lone bird on high telephone wire; silent 

- [ ] **Eastern Gray Squirrel** (*Sciurus carolinensis*) - foraging; later observed entering nest (rarely witnessed personally) 

- [ ] **Eastern Cottontail** (*Sylvilagus floridanus*) - small brownish‑gray rabbit with white tail, avoiding domestic dog 

- [ ] **Stoneflies** (Order *Plecoptera*) - multiple on wooden and aluminum railings; photos taken (add later)

- [ ] **Lesser Celandine** (*Ficaria verna*) - dense groundcover in wooded patch; bright yellow blooms recalled from spring last year

- [ ] **American Sycamore** (*Platanus occidentalis*) - numerous seed balls on the ground today

- [ ] **Tracks** - many domestic dog paw prints in soft mud; one possible deer print (uncertain)

- [ ] **Non-biological** - river high (“fat”) with ~1 ft visibility in shallows, clearer than yesterday; banks muddy; noticeable earthy/decay odor today



### General Description of Activities

Usual unhurried route along Greenway; frequent stops to listen/scan. Spoke briefly with two anglers; neither had caught anything; one casting in same pocket as Herb used yesterday. Used Merlin Bird ID to confirm several calls; took photos of a songbird and of stoneflies on railings. Used Seek app to identify unfamiliar plant "Lesser Celandine"


### Descriptions & Field Notes
#### Birds
##### **[[Blue Jay]]** 

  - Morphology/ID clues: classic blue/white pattern; strong flight; raspy calls (heard earlier in walk) 

  - Habitat micro-site: Tallest sycamore at north bank; topmost branch; apparently surveying area

  - Notes: Observed flight path heading East along river center → perch

  
##### **[[Canada Geese]] (multiple encounters)** 

  - Counts: Several distinct clusters/events (see list above); some likely repeats of individuals along route 

  - Notable Behavior: Group of four plus a lagging loner swimming hard upriver against current; assumed 1 male and 3 females based on size; loner also apparently male; later apparent confrontation between two presumed males; trio moved toward south bank and exited river. leaving 2 apparent males swimming ~20ft apart near north bank; possible territorial/mating context (speculative) 

  - Notes: Flock extremely tolerant of nearby male [[mallard]]; group of 4 geese surrounding lone mallard with no apparent conflict or territorialism.

  

##### **[[Song Sparrow]]** 

  - Vocals: Two very different song patterns noted today; reminder to work on improving call ID; Merlin assisted 

  - Photos/Sketch refs: `![ [ADD: 2026-02-18_song_sparrow.jpg] ]` 

  - Confidence/Similar species considered: High. 

  

##### **[[Yellow‑Rumped Warbler]]** 

  - Habitat sighting: Shrubs/brush tight to river edge, group of 6-10.

  - Notes: Quick movements; photo attempt unsuccessful.

  - Confidence: Medium - Merlin audio ID + brief visual of yellow patches on chest.

  

##### **[[White‑crowned Sparrow]] (audio-only)** 

  - Notes: Merlin call ID without visual confirmation; treat as tentative

  

#### **[[American Robin]] / [[Northern Cardinal]] / [[Rock Pigeon]]** 

  - Notes: Robin seen actively calling; Cardinal heard; lone pigeon perched quietly on wire above roadway

#### Mammals

#### **[[Eastern Gray Squirrel]]** 

  - Notes: Entered leafy nest head‑first; then turned and looked out; personal first to witness entry behavior 

  - Questions: Adhesion/structure of nest; occupancy (solo vs shared); wall thickness

  

#### **[[Eastern Cottontail]] Rabbit** 

  - Notes: Small brownish‑gray rabbit; white tail evident; dog on roadway scented it and was eager to give chase

  
#### Insects
##### **[[Stoneflies]]** 

  - Microhabitat/substrate: On wooden railing (yesterday’s spot) and aluminum railing at Colorado St. Bridge today 

  - Photos/Sketch refs: `![ [ADD: 2026-02-18_stoneflies_bridge.jpg] ]`

  
#### Plants
##### **[[Lesser Celandine]]** 

  - Notes: Lush green carpet across forest floor; first vigorous emergence since snow melt; bright yellow blooms expected later based on last spring

  

##### **[[Sycamore]] (seed balls)** 

  - Notes: Noticeably more on ground than prior days and many broken open unsure if seasonal timing or last night’s storm knocked them down

  

#### **Water & substrate** 

  - Clarity: Somewhat opaque but clearer than prior days; ~1 ft visibility to bottom in shallows 

  - Odor: Distinct earthy/decay smell today - possible microbial activity uptick with warmer temps & rain 

  - Substrate: Edges soft/muddy; many domestic dog prints; one uncertain deer track. Noted a muddy area recently exposed by receding water levels, with no apparent disturbance; will check this location again to see if new tracks appear.

  

### Behavior & Patterns

- Birds noticeably more vocal today with overcast but mild temps; geese showing possible territorial/mating interactions. 

- Early green-up in shaded woods driven by lesser celandine; snowpack fully melted. 

- Sycamore seed dispersal notable today-potential storm effect. 

- River remains high with limited drainage since yesterday; forecasted continuing rain could push levels to flooding and may inundate sections of the Greenway if trend persists.

## To‑Do / Follow‑ups

- [ ] Embed photos (songbird; stoneflies at wooden & aluminum railings; lesser celandine) 

- [x] Cross-check Merlin audio IDs (song sparrow variants; yellow-rumped warbler; white‑crowned sparrow) 

- [x] Add yesterday’s **groundhog** (north side of river) to 2026‑02‑17 entry 

- [ ] Record coordinates/elevation for Colorado St. Bridge spot next visit 

- [ ] Keep tabs on river level vs. forecast; note any Greenway flooding

- [ ] Look into duck/goose tolerance of each other

- [ ] Look into purpose/ structure of Sycamore seed balls

- [ ] Check clear muddy area in coming days for appearance of more animal prints

- [ ] Work on improving bird call identification
