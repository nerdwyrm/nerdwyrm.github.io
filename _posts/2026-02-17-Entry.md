# 2026-02-17 – Nature Journal

> **Time:** 12:30 – 13:00

> **Location:** 

>     General: Roanoke River Greenway 

>     Specific: Between the Colorado Street Bridge and small feeder creek 

> **Coordinates/Elevation:** 

> **Companions:** None 

> **Habitat:** Riparian corridor-river, creek, sycamores, winter–early spring vegetation

## Weather

**Current** 

- Temp: ~65°F (warmer than yesterday) 

- Sky: Mostly sunny with a few wispy clouds 

- Wind: *Not noted* 

- Precipitation: None

  

**Recent** 

- Last 24h: River still high from recent melt/flooding; snow nearly gone except a few patches near the bridge 

- Last week / seasonal context: Extended snow cover for weeks; now warming and showing first greens of early spring

## Quick Context

- **Purpose/Focus of outing:** Midday walk from work; observing river conditions, wildlife, and seasonal transitions. 

- **Route/Area covered:** Greenway near work → toward Colorado Street Bridge → across small feeder creek. 

- **Notable phenology today:** 

  - First noticeable greening of grass after long snow cover 

  - Increased sun warmth & longer days 

  - Possible increase in stone fly activity based on fisherman’s comments

## Observations (Main Body)

  

### Species/Things Observed

- [ ] **Mallard Ducks** (*Anas platyrhynchos*) - 1 male (green head), 1 female; flying then landing, later resting in eddy behind brush 

- [ ] **Small unidentified songbirds** - heard on north side of river near creek bridge; not seen 

- [ ] **Sycamore trees** (*Platanus occidentalis*) - flaky bark, seed pods still attached; various sizes 

- [ ] **River conditions** - high, fast, slightly clearer than yesterday, still murky; nearly up to the Greenway 

- [ ] **Leaf litter accumulations** - pressed against twigs/branches by high water; possibly affecting stone fly habitat 

- [ ] **Creek conditions** - very clear; bottom visible; ~1 ft deep; trickling under bridge after being flooded 

- [ ] **Stoneflies** (order Plecoptera) — Two adults observed crawling on a wooden railing, identified by Herb the fisherman. One male and one female; male larger with more prominent wings.

- [ ] **Fishermen** - multiple; one (“Herb”) fly‑fishing with stone-fly‑style flies; no catches reported 

  

### General Description of Activities

Walked the usual route along the Roanoke River Greenway, pausing often to observe river height, clarity, wildlife presence/absence, and to talk with a familiar fisherman (Herb). Reflected on absence of typical bird activity and on seasonal transitions after snowmelt.

  

### Descriptions & Field Notes

  

#### **[[Mallard]] Ducks**

- **Morphology/ID clues:** Male with green head; female brown. 

- **Habitat micro-site:** Resting in calm eddy behind leaves and brush on river edge. 

- **Notes:** Only ducks seen today, compared to recent geese-heavy days.

  

#### **Small Songbirds (unidentified)**

- **Vocalizations:** Light birdsong heard near the north side of the river as I approached the creek bridge. 

- **Notes:** Not visually identified.

  

#### **[[Sycamore|Sycamores]]**

- **Morphology/ID clues:** Flaky bark; hanging seed balls. 

- **Notes:** Present in varied sizes along the riverbank. More large individuals on the North side bank.

  

#### **River & Creek Conditions**

- **River:** High, fast, slightly clearer than yesterday, still murky; nearly up to the Greenway. 

- **Creek:** Very clear; ~1 ft deep; trickling under bridge after flooding.

  

#### **[[Stoneflies|Stone Fly]] Discussion**

- Notes from Herb: stone flies develop as nymphs in leaf litter underwater, then emerge in spring and rest on riverside rocks. He tied flies to mimic them for seasonal fishing conditions.

- Identification:
	  - Morphology/ID clues: flattened body; wings held flat over back; emerged adults
	  - Microhabitat/substrate: handrail above fast, high river; abundant leaf-litter nearby
	  - Confidence/Similar groups: high at order; comparison to other recent identifications on iNaturalist lead me to believe the individuals I saw were of the superfamily "Nemouridae"

## Behavior & Patterns

- River wildlife relatively quiet today; no geese, no herons spotted, ducks scarce. 

- Fishermen present in greater numbers due to warmer weather but not catching fish. 

- Leaf litter buildup may indicate recent flooding and influence aquatic insect activity.
