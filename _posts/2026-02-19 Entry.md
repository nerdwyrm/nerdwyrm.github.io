## Quick Context

- **Purpose/Focus of outing:** Usual midday Greenway check: river conditions, birds, early-season changes 

- **Route/Area covered:** From Colorado Street Bridge eastward along south bank; pauses near muddy patches and shallow north-bank eddies 

- **Notable phenology today:** Grass much greener; river clarity slowly improving with steady rain after prior storm’s sediment pulse

## Observations

### Species/Things Observed

- [ ] American Crows (*Corvus brachyrhynchos*) - several pecking in grass near the bridge; one perched high surveying 

- [ ] Song Sparrow (*Melospiza melodia*) - two individuals foraging silently in leaf litter on south bank 

- [ ] Mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*) - two males loafing in shallow north-bank water; later two females chasing each other up and down the river 

- [ ] Carolina Chickadee (*Poecile carolinensis*) - call heard and confirmed via Merlin 

- [ ] Tracks - deer prints in mud oriented as if exiting the river; many fresh goose droppings observed; photo of tracks taken (add later) 

- [ ] Invertebrates - small grub-like pale brown worms on greenway pavement edges, photo taken

- [ ] River/Water - level high and loaded; clarity gradually improving after earlier sediment pulse 

- [ ] People - several anglers out despite drizzle and deep water; no catches seen, photo taken

  

### General Description of Activities

Usual loop along the Greenway from the Colorado Street Bridge; watched sparrows foraging, checked muddy patches for prints, and scanned eddies for ducks; observed anglers without stopping to chat.

  

### Descriptions & Field Notes

- **Song Sparrow (silent foragers)** 

  - Habitat micro-site: South-bank leaf litter near trail edge 

  - Notes: Both individuals quiet; possible foraging on aquatic insect nymphs or similar in litter (unconfirmed)

  

- **Mallards** 

  - Notes: Two males resting in shallow water on the north side; later two females engaged in chase behavior along the channel

  

- **Carolina Chickadee (audio)** 

  - Notes: Merlin confirmation; no visual; proud of myself for recognizing the call by ear

  

- **Tracks** 

  - Notes: Deer prints oriented out of river; photo reminder

  

- **Invertebrates** 

  - Notes: Grub-like forms at pavement margin; one moved on foot rather than taking flight

  

### Behavior & Patterns

- Birds relatively subdued vocally, with ducks showing mild chase behavior among females. 

- River clarity showing gradual improvement after the heavier sediment from the earlier storm.
