- [ ] Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) detected by Merlin only

- [ ] American Goldfinch (Spinus tristis) detected by Merlin only, searched hard but no visual

- [ ] Abundant goose and duck droppings on the Greenway trail

  

### Plants and invertebrates

- [ ] Great mullein identified with Seek: large fuzzy leaves in a basal rosette; boxelder bug observed crawling on the plant

- [ ] Garlic mustard identified with Seek: fresh emergence noted

- [ ] White pumpkin, a little smaller than volleyball, likely dumped as human waste, substantially rotten, notable as having multiple bite marks from animals
  

### River and substrate

- River level high and remarkably clear; estimated 4 to 5 feet deep mid channel with bottom visible without polarized glasses

- Eddies unusually clean with very little driftwood or debris and only a few stationary bubbles

- Water odor notably clean and fresh

  

### People and conversations

- Talked with Herb the fisherman 

  - Using imitation stonefly nymph for fly fishing 

  - Reported 10 trout yesterday including one around 5 pounds, typical sizes 10 to 12 inches 

  - Caught 6 more today 

  - Observation: when water is high, clear, and flowing well, stocked trout are active and abundant

  

### General description of activities

Casual progress along usual route with frequent stops to listen for calls, scan eddies, and inspect emerging plants. Spent time attempting photos of a Carolina Wren and searching for the American Goldfinch that was calling but not visible. Brief conversation with Herb about current fishing conditions and results.

  

### Behavior and patterns

- Bird activity mixed with many detections by sound; some species remained out of sight despite focused searching

- Early season plants expanding quickly as weather oscillates between cold nights and rainy, mild days

- River clarity unusually high, with even slow moving areas clear of debris
